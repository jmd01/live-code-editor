# Live Code Editor
Live code editor allows you to create multi file Javascript and Typescript apps directly in the browser, similar to Code Sandbox and Stackblitz.

From the UI, add your dependencies and their versions and Live Code Editor will download the dependency tree. 

Create files and import your dependencies then start coding your app.

LiveCode Editor will compile, bundle and create a live preview of your app on every code edit, all from within the client.
